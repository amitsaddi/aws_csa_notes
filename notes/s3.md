# Simple Storage Service (S3) - REGIONAL

- Regional: All data
- Global: bucket names 
- Supports BitTorrent for object smaller than 5gb
Object storage 
- Traffic Acceleration from around the world

### Buckets 
  - container for objects
  - names are global and unique
  - data is stored in regions
  - bucket name max 63 lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, periods

### Objects
  - stores data (bytes) and metadata
  - max size 5TB (min 0b)
  - metadata: system and user (specified at creation)
### Keys 
  - max 1024 UTF-8 chars.
  - unique within a bucket

### Important
  - No folders, key can contain backslashes:
  bucket`/some/directory/x.com` - file name 
  - No hierarchy just prefixes and delimiters

## Consistency
  - eventual
  - Read-After-Write on PUTS new objects
  - Eventual for the rest
  - You might see file after DELETE

## Access Control
  - ACL on object - does not allow to make all object publicly available (only single object)
  - Bucket policy, restriction on AWS account, Ip Address, time
  - MFA for delete
  - pre-signed url for GET and PUT

## Lifecycle Management
  - Change storage class after some time
  - Can delete files after expiring

## Encryption
  - In transit - SSL 
  - At rest:
    - SSE (server side encryption) s3 - managed by s3
    - SSE KMS - managed by s3 with additional controls over master key and access control
    - SSE C - customer provided keys
    - Client side encryption
  - Encryption on Object/Version level
  - You can encrypt object which already exists - go to properties and click encrypt

## Versioning
  - Can be enabled, but can only be suspended
  - Multi Factor Delete - only from root accout

### Pre Signed Url 
  - time based access url to resource
### Multipart upload
  - recommended above 100 MB
  - required above 5GB
### Range get
  - You can read only range of bytes from object

### Cross region replication
  - replicate only user initiated actions (can't chain cross region replications), it will not replicate files deleted by lifecycle
  - Will only replicate new objects, not existing ones
  - Metadata and ACLs are replicated

### Event notifications
  - setup on bucket level
  - Targets:
    - SNS
    - SQS
    - Lambda
  - Can be used to replace lost object in RRS

### Logs
  - contain ip, bucket, time, action, response
  - delivered on a best-effort basic
  - might be delayed

### Performance 
  - You may need to randomize object names above 100 req/s

### Static Website Hosting
  - You can host static website
  - You can have custom 404 error page 
  - CORS configuration for different domain
  - bucket name has to be the same as you custom domain to set up CNAME

# Glacier - Regional
  Data is stored in Archives (think tar files) and organized in vaults (think folders)
  ## Archives
    - data stored in archives 
    - max size 40 TB
    - unique archive ID - service generated
    - immutable, cant' be changed
  ## Vaults
    - containers for archives
    - max 1000 vaults
  ### Vault Locks
    - for compliance
    - you can specify WORM (Write Once Read Many) policy
    - Once locked policy can no longer by changed
  ## Encryption
    - Encrypted by default
